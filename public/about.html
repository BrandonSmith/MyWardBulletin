      <p>ZionBoard began as a simple way to share digital ward bulletins. I wanted an easy tool to create, print, and share bulletins without complicated software. Everything runs in your browser, so your information stays private and secure.</p>
      <p>The platform is completely independent from ward or stake systems. You don&#39;t need access to any membership data to get started&mdash;just create a bulletin and share it with your ward. Your QR code is permanent and will always point to the latest version of your bulletin, even if you move to a new ward.</p>
      <p>We offer a growing set of features: reusable bulletin templates, PDF export, and public links for easy sharing. More functionality is coming, and I&#39;m happy to add what you need.</p>
      <p>If you have suggestions or want additional features, send me an email at <a href="mailto:matthew@zionboard.com">matthew@zionboard.com</a>. I would love to hear how you use ZionBoard.</p>
