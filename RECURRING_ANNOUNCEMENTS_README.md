# Recurring Announcements Feature

This feature allows you to create announcements that can be automatically reused across multiple bulletins, making it easy to maintain consistent information week after week.

## What are Recurring Announcements?

Recurring announcements are announcements that you want to appear in multiple bulletins without having to retype them each time. Examples include:
- Ward temple night information
- Regular meeting schedules
- Contact information for ward leaders
- Ongoing service opportunities
- Standard ward policies

   - **Content**: The full announcement content (supports rich text)
   - **Category**: Choose from general, baptism, birthday, calling, activity, service, or other

## Database Schema

- Stores the master list of recurring announcements
- Each announcement is tied to a specific ward profile
- Supports soft deletion (marking as inactive)

### Updated `announcement_submissions`
- Added `is_recurring` and `recurrence_pattern` fields
- Allows submissions to be marked as recurring

## Technical Implementation

- **BulletinForm**: Enhanced with recurring announcements button and convert functionality
- **EditorApp**: Added "Add Recurring" button to populate current bulletin

### Services

## Best Practices

### Creating Recurring Announcements
1. **Keep Content Generic**: Avoid specific dates or times that change weekly
2. **Use Clear Titles**: Make it easy to identify what each announcement is for

2. **Batch Operations**: Use "Add Recurring" to quickly populate new bulletins
3. **Customize as Needed**: Modify recurring announcements in individual bulletins when needed
4. **Backup Important**: Keep copies of important recurring announcements

## Migration Notes
